        <h1>What is JDM?</h1>
        <p>
          The term JDM is an acronym for Japanese Domestic Market. It references the fact that these cars are meant for
          the Japanese public and, thus, have specific features custom-tailored for the population there. But, more
          often than not, there are some misconceptions.

          If the manufacturers made the auto in Japan but sold it on the international market in the US, Europe, or
          elsewhere, it’s not a JDM vehicle. It would always lack particular quirks and features that should comply with
          Japanese laws and regulations.

          Unlike Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, JDMs should never really be sold in the United States. However,
          sometimes they get imported through specific channels and bought by those seeking to own something unique. But
          that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know just what the difference is, as it’s easy to make a mistake when
          purchasing.</p>

        <h1>Why is JDM significant?</h1>
        <p>Many car enthusiasts and collectors consider JDMN vehicles to be highly desirable because of their unique
          features and high quality. In Japan, there are strict regulations on vehicle emissions and safety, which often
          lead to the production of high-performance cars that are not available in other markets.
          Here it’s mostly happy news for JDM seekers as the vehicles differ from USDMs in a significant way. More
          notables distinctions include the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><strong>Dependability.</strong></strong> All Japanese cars have a reputation for lasting a very
            long time. The parts for these vehicles are of incredible quality and will undoubtedly provide you with the
            longevity you need.</li>
          <li><strong>Higher resale value.</strong> JMDs are rare and beloved in America, so it always makes for a
            higher resale value. Plus, if the auto was imported, you can incorporate these costs into the resale price
            and increase the overall value.</li>
          <li><strong>Car parts of higher quality.</strong> One of the quirks of the Japanese market is that it’s pretty
            easy to find OEMs. This is due to the increased ownership turnover rate but only serves to benefit the buyer
            in the long run.</li>
        </ul>
        <article>
          <h1>What are some examples of JDMN cars?</h1>
          <p>Some well-known JDMN cars include the Honda NSX, Nissan Skyline GT-R, and Toyota Supra. These cars are
            highly
            sought after by car enthusiasts around the world, and are often imported from Japan at a premium price. 
            but also i wanna make it clear that the industry of the 7th Art has affected the community and this market in many ways and that  
            20 years ago since the premiere of The Fast and the Furious, when we saw Vin Diesel in a classic Dodge Charger race the late Paul Walker in a Toyota Supra across a set of train tracks, barely missing the fast-moving train.
